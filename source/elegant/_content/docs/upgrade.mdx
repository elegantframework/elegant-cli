## Upgrading to 2.3 from 2.x

Elegant version 2.3 contains a number of package updates and minor breaking changes.

Read the complete announcement here: [Elegant v2.3 production release](https://www.elegantframework.com/blog/2023-07-14-elegant-v2-3-production).

## Updating Dependencies

##### ***Likelihood Of Impact: High***

**React 18 Required**

Elegant now requires React 18.2.0 or greater.

**Node.js 18 Required**

Elegant now requires Node.js version 18 or greater.

**MDX-Loader 2 Required**

Elegant now requires MDX-Loader or greater.

**Node.js 16** Supported

Elegant also supports Node.js version 16 in addition to the version mentioned above.

## .npmrc File

##### ***Likelihood Of Impact: Low***

We have included a .npmrc file in the latest version of Elegant to force developers to install Elegant using the proper version of Node.js.

## Blogging

**Blog Excerpt Tags**

##### ***Likelihood Of Impact: High***

We have updated the Excerpt tags used in the blog portion of Elegant.

The upgrade to React 18 and MDX-Loader 2 forced us to convert from the previous excerpt tag format to a new opening and closing format.

Please see our sample blog posts included in Elegant version 2.3 for more information.

## Configuration

**Next.config.js**

##### ***Likelihood Of Impact: High***

The `next.config.js` configuration file has been converted to ECMAScript, and is now named `next.config.mjs`.

**Authors Configuration**

##### ***Likelihood Of Impact: Low***

The blog authors' configuration has been moved to the \`/config\` namespace.

**Navigation Configuration**

##### ***Likelihood Of Impact: Low***

The sidebar navigation has also been moved to the \`/config\` namespace.
