## Introduction

Often one of the biggest challenges when starting a new project or application is creating and maintaining documentation for users and developers. Elegant provides a simple, and powerful tool for creating and managing beautiful documentation.

## Creating Documentation with Markdown

To get started, create a new Markdown file, `elegant.mdx`, and place it under the `src/pages/docs/` directory within your project.

```bash
website # root directory of your site
├── css
├── src
│    └── pages
│         └── docs
│              └── elegant.mdx
├── .env
├── next.config.js
├── package.json
├── tailwind.config.js
├── ...
```

Add the following Markdown to our sample `elegant.mdx` file.

```md

title: Hello World
description: Create a beautiful documentation page with static rich content.
