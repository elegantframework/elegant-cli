Australian metalcore trailblazers **THE AMITY AFFLICTION** — **Joel Birch** \[vocals\], **Ahren Stringer** \[vocals, bass\], **Dan Brown** \[lead guitar\], and Joe **Longobardi** \[drums\] — will return to North America for a headline tour this spring.

On this run, the band will be celebrating the 10th anniversary of their beloved and iconic metal album ***Let the Ocean Take Me*** and will be performing the album in its entirety. It's no doubt a treat for the diehard fans to see favorites like "Pittsburgh," "Don't Lean On Me," and more.

The tour kicks off April 26 in San Diego and runs through June 6 in Los Angeles.

**Currents**, **Dying Wish**, and **Mugshot** will serve as support. All dates are below. Tickets go on sale on Thursday, January 25 at 10 am local time. Get tickets [here](https://atomsplitterpr.us6.list-manage.com/track/click?u=db1855ab84d45f76eff7f68dd&id=ba7fd105c4&e=f6d2a12b5d).
