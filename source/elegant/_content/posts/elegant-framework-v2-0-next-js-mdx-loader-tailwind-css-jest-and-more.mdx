We are excited to announce the latest version of Elegant, version 2.0! This major version brings with it a number of large improvements over the previous version.

![](/images/v2_0_elegantframework_com-E3MT.png)The first version of Elegant started life as an experiment. We had a theory that we could build a more simple WordPress, geared for developers just like ourselves.

We knew that we could build a beautiful React.js frontend framework and that it could be used to write its own documentation as we built it.

Our initial release leveraged Docusaurus for its markdown feature. While Docusaurus was great for building a minimum viable product, it was very limited in features and extendability.

Some of our favorite updates from this release are highlighted below.

## **Next.JS**

Next.js is an open-source web development framework providing React-based web applications with server-side rendering and static website generation. Next.js is one of the top cutting-edge technologies leading the way in a JavaScript revolution, so it only made sense for us to use it for this project.

## **MDX Loader**

MDX Loader is a frontend build utility that lets Elegant seamlessly convert Markdown files inside of your Elegant application into React-based pages.

You can write your content pages like this:<br>
