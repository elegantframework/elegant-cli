We are excited to announce the latest version of Elegant, version 2.0! This major version brings with it a number of large improvements over the previous version.

![](/images/v2_0_elegantframework_com-E3MT.png)The first version of Elegant started life as an experiment. We had a theory that we could build a more simple WordPress, geared for developers just like ourselves.

We knew that we could build a beautiful React.js frontend framework and that it could be used to write its own documentation as we built it.

Our initial release leveraged Docusaurus for its markdown feature. While Docusaurus was great for building a minimum viable product, it was very limited in features and extendability.

Some of our favorite updates from this release are highlighted below.

## **Next.JS**

Next.js is an open-source web development framework providing React-based web applications with server-side rendering and static website generation. Next.js is one of the top cutting-edge technologies leading the way in a JavaScript revolution, so it only made sense for us to use it for this project.

## **MDX Loader**

MDX Loader is a frontend build utility that lets Elegant seamlessly convert Markdown files inside of your Elegant application into React-based pages.

You can write your content pages like this:

\`\`\`diff-html welcome.mdx

## Markdown is super simple and elegant to write.

Hello? (Hello, hello, hello) <br>

Is there anybody in there? <br>

Just nod if you can hear me. <br>

Is there anyone at home? \`\`\`

## **Tailwind CSS**

<br>

Tailwind is an open-source CSS framework of CSS design tokens and utility classes. CSS design tokens make it easier to make smart, efficient choices from beautifully curated palettes. Design tokens also create a common language for everyone who uses Tailwind - both across teams and projects, which can break down communication barriers.

Tailwind CSS allows us to easily create perfectly crafted themes that implement standards and best practices from the best frontend designers and developers.



---

## **Jest Unit Testing**

<br>

Jest is a JavaScript testing framework created by Meta (Formerly Facebook). It was designed with a focus on simplicity and support for large web applications. Elegant comes pre-configured straight out of the box with a large number of Jest unit tests. Our goal is to provide 100% test coverage across the Elegant Framework.

Make a code change within Elegant and have 100% confidence that everything works as you expect, every time.
