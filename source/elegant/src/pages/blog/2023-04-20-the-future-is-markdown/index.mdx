Using markdown for writing content has some advantages over traditional blogging and content management systems such as WordPress:

## Safety
- Markdown files are just plain old text files, so they are less prone to malware or hacking compared to a traditional website.
- There is no database to manage or keep secure, and no PHP web server to attack.
- Markdown files can be easily backed up, version controlled, and recovered. This makes them safer than content stored in a WordPress or Drupal database.

## Efficiency
- Markdown files load faster than WordPress pages. They don't require any database queries or PHP processing
- Markdown is simpler to write and edit compared to WordPress posts. You can focus on just writing without dealing with editor buttons, media uploads, etc.

## Portability
- Markdown files are portable. You can easily move them between Elegant and other static site generators, or convert them to other formats for different social media platforms.
- Your content is not locked into a platform such as WordPress or Drupal. If you decide to try another content platform, all of your content can be migrated without any headaches.
