## General

Thanks for your interest in contributing to the Elegant framework! Please take a moment to review this document **before submitting a pull request**.



## Pull requests

**Please ask first before starting work on any significant new features.**

It's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined after investing a lot of time and effort into a new feature. To avoid this from happening, we request that contributors create a feature request to first discuss any significant new ideas.



## Running tests

You can run the test suite using the following commands:

```sh
npm test
```

Please ensure that the tests are passing when submitting a pull request. If you're adding new features to Elegant, please include tests.
