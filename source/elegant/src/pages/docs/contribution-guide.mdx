## Pull requests

**Please ask first before starting work on any significant new features.**

It's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined after investing a lot of time and effort into a new feature. To avoid this from happening, we request that contributors create a feature request to first discuss any significant new ideas.

## Running tests

You can run the test suite using the following commands:
