Welcome to the Elegant Contribution Guide! We're excited to have you here.

This page provides instructions on how to download and contribute to the core Elegant Framework code. Our goal is to ensure that everyone in the community feels empowered to contribute and improve our code.

## Why Contribute?

Open-source work is never done, and neither is innovation. Contributing to a fast growing JavaScript project is a good way for beginners to get involved in open-source, and for experienced developers to contribute more complex ideas while providing value to the development community.

By contributing to the Elegant Framework project, you're helping us build a more robust application development experience for all developers. Whether you've found a typo, some confusing code, or you've realized that a particular feature is missing, your contributions are welcomed and appreciated.

## Pull requests

**Please ask first before starting work on any significant new features.**

It's never a fun experience to have your pull request declined after investing a lot of time and effort into a new feature. To avoid this from happening, we request that contributors create a feature request to first discuss any significant new ideas.

## Running tests

You can run the test suite using the following commands:

```sh
npm test
```

Please ensure that the tests are passing when submitting a pull request. If you're adding new features to Elegant, please include tests.
