## Meet Elegant

Elegant is a content creation framework for rapidly building beautiful and expressive web applications. A CMS framework provides a structure and a starting point for creating a beautiful application, blog, or documentation website.

### Why Elegant?

There are a variety of tools and frameworks available to you when building a frontend application. However, we believe Elegant is the best choice for building amazing, and elegant web applications.

## Your First Elegant Application

Before creating your first Elegant application, you should ensure that your local machine has [Node and NPM](https://nodejs.org) installed.

The next step is to install the Elegant CLI tool via npm.

```nothing
npm install elegant-cli
```

After you have installed the Elegant CLI tool, you may create a new Elegant documentation project via the NPM `npx elegant-init` command:

```nothing
npx elegant-init
```

After the project has been created, install the required Node packages, and start Elegant's local development server using npm:

```nothing
npm install

npm run dev
```

Once you have started the Elegant development server, your application will be accessible in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000/docs`.

To stop the Elegant development server, press the `ctrl` and `c` keys together in the terminal:

```nothing
ctrl + c
```

## Initial Configuration

Elegant needs almost no additional configuration out of the box. You are free to get started developing!

### Environment Based Configuration

Since many of Elegant's configuration option values may vary depending on whether your application is running on your local machine or on a production web server, many important configuration values are defined using the `.env` file that exists at the root of your application.

Your `.env` file should not be committed to your application's source control, since each developer / server using your application could require a different environment configuration. Furthermore, this would be a security risk in the event an intruder gains access to your source control repository, since any sensitive credentials would get exposed.

> **Note**  
> For more information about the `.env` file and environment based configuration, check out the full [configuration documentation](/docs/configuration#environment-configuration).
