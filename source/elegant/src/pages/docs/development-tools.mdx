We use a few different tools internally for all of our development needs.

## Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code, also commonly referred to as VS Code, is a source-code editor created by Microsoft.

VS Code is the preferred IDE for React developers currently, as well as internally at Elegant. VS Code is free to all users and contains every tool needed for your development workflows.

## GitHub Desktop

GitHub Desktop is an application that enables you to interact with GitHub using a user interface, instead of the command line or a web browser. GitHub Desktop encourages you and your team to collaborate using best practices with Git and GitHub.

We use GitHub desktop internally for all of our source control and Git contributions. Using the GitHub desktop client is a major improvement over using the command line.

## Figma

Figma is a collaborative web application for vector graphics editor and designs.

We use Figma internally for our graphic design needs, including creating SVGs and icons used throughout this site. Figma offers a free starter plan which is great for startups or those on a budget.
