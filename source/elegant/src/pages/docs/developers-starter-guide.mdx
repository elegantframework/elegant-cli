How to download and get started contributing to the core Elegant project.

## Innovators Release

The innovators tag on npm is a prerelease tag for the version currently being developed. When we merge pull requests into the main branch, we run `npm run publish:innovators`, and it will push the changes to a pre-release version on npm.

Developers and innovative Elegant users who want to preview features can download the innovators version with

`npm i elegant-cli --tag innovators`.
