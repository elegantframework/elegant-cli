You can easily view the changes with the [GitHub comparison tool](https://github.com/elegantframework/elegant-cli/compare/v2.2-stableâ€¦v2.3) and choose which updates are important to you.

## App Type

##### **Likelihood Of Impact: Low**

The app type is now set using the `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_TYPE` variable.

The `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_TYPE` variable determines whether web applications schema.org metadata is set to a "Corporate" type, or a "Personal" type.

By default, all new Elegant applications have their .env configuration files set to the `Organization` type.

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_TYPE="Organization"
```

Setting the `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_TYPE` environment variable to `Personal` will turn your Elegant applications schema data into a personal web application.

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_TYPE="Personal"
```

## Config Namespace

##### **Likelihood Of Impact: Low**

Elegant now has a `config/` namespace under the root folder of the application. The config directory will serve as the full configuration namespace for all future versions of Elegant.

As Elegant grows and expands in functionality and services, the config namespace will handle all configuration types, such as email services, authentication providers, and database storage services.
