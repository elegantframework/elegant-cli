## Splash Pages
##### **Likelihood Of Impact: Very Low**

We have included a separate splash page layout template for creating reusable landing pages.

<a name="tailwind-css"></a>

## Tailwind
##### **Likelihood Of Impact: Very Low**

Simple theme coloring is now set in the `tailwind.config.js` file. Though it's not required, setting primary, secondary, and other theme colors in the `tailwind.config.js` file is the recommended method. 

For example if a user changes the primary color value, the change will be propagated across the app automatically.
