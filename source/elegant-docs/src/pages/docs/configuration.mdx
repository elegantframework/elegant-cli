## Environment Configuration

It is often helpful to have different configuration values based on the environment where the application is running. For example, you may wish to use a different Google Analytics tag locally than you do on your production server.

To make this a cinch, Elegant utilizes the [DotEnv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) NPM library. In a fresh Elegant installation, the root directory of your application will contain a `.env.example` file that defines many common environment variables. During the Elegant installation process, this file will automatically be copied to `.env`.

Elegant's default `.env` file contains some common configuration values that may differ based on whether your application is running locally or on a production web server.

If you are developing with a team, you may wish to continue including a `.env.example` file with your application. By putting placeholder values in the example configuration file, other developers on your team can clearly see which environment variables are needed to run your application.

> **Note**  
> Any variable in your `.env` file can be overridden by external environment variables such as server-level or system-level environment variables.

## Environment File Security

Your `.env` file should not be committed to your application's source control, since each developer / server using your application could require a different environment configuration. Furthermore, this would be a security risk in the event an intruder gains access to your source control repository, since any sensitive credentials would get exposed.

If you need to define an environment variable with a value that contains spaces, you may do so by enclosing the value in double quotes:

```ini
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME="My Application"
```

###  Retrieving Environment Configuration

All of the variables listed in the `.env` file will be loaded into the `process.env` Node super-global variable when your application is built. However, you may use the `env` function to retrieve values from these variables in your configuration files. 

To access the `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME` environment variable in your application, simply reference the super Node super-global environment variable:

```nothing
let title = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME
```
> **Note**  
> We have prefixed the environment variables within your `.env` file with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` to make this application compatible with Vercel.com hosting and Next.js.
