## Creating Documentation with Markdown

To get started, create a new Markdown file, `elegant.md`, and place it under the `docs` directory.

```bash
website # root directory of your site
├── docs
│   └── elegant.md
├── src
│   └── css
├── .env
├── .package.json
├── ...
```

Add the following Markdown to our sample `elegant.md` file.

```md
---
description: Create a beautiful documentation page with static rich content.
